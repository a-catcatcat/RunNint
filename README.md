# RunNint

RunNint is a collection of iOS tweaks that allow you to play various Nintendo apps (Fire Emblem Heroes, Miitomo, Pok√©mon Go) on a jailbroken device.

## Usage

- Until this is published, pre-build .deb packages should be in the `packages` folder in each tweak folder. These should work under 32-bit as well, but they are so far only tested on 64-bit devices. These can be installed with any usual .deb installer, such as Filza.
- Compile with THEOS, `make package FINALPACKAGE=1` in each tweak folder.

## Why
On a jailbroken iOS device, these applications will quit immediately after launching. This offers a method of being able to run these applications in spite of jailbreak detection. 

**I am not liable for any consequences you may incur by abusing this tweak or using it improperly, nor do I condone any such actions. The sole purpose of this tweak is such that a user with a jailbroken device may still play these games just as a user with a non-jailbroken device would.**
